# Introduction

Welcome to the Waitlisted API! You can use our API to access Waitlisted API endpoints.

We have language bindings in Shell, Javascript, and Ruby! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Considerations

All api requests should be made to your waitlisted app domain. This is the domain you see when you sign in to waitlisted.com

If you app is called kittens, your app domain is likely something along the lines of kittens.app.waitlisted.co

This is the endpoint you should use when accessing the waitlisted api. If you were accessing a reservation you would want to hit, 'https://kittens.app.waitlisted.co/api/v1/reservation'

# Libraries
